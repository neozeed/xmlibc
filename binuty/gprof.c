   NAME is the name of the function or cycle.
   VALUE is the address of the start of the function.

   CALLS and CALLED are chains of edges for calls into and out of
   this function.  These constitute the call graph.

   NCALLS is the total number
   of times this function called other functions,
   NCALLED is the total number of times this function was called.
   Note that if NCALLED is zero, but NCALLS is nozero, this function
   must have been started magically.  It happens.  (Signals, etc.)

   RECURSIVE is the total number of times this function was called
   recursively.

   HISTO is the total number of histogram counts for this function.

   SUB_HISTO is the total number of histogram counts for this function
   plus time propagated from the children.

   CYCNUM is the number of the cycle this function is in,
   or the number of this cycle is this entry is for a cycle.
   -1 means the function isn't in any cycles.  0 means the
   cycle-ness of the function hasn't been determined yet.

   NUMINDEX is the index number assigned to this function
   for the call graph.

   If FLAG is non-zero, this function is in the process of being

 This table describes the call tree of the program, and was sorted by\n\
 the total amount of time spent in each function and its children.\n\n\
 Each entry in this table consists of several lines.  The line with the\n\
 index number at the left hand margin lists the current function.\n\
 The lines above it list the functions that called this function,\n\
 and the lines below it list the functions this one called.\n\
 This line lists:\n\
     index	A unique number given to each element of the table.\n\
		Index numbers are sorted numerically.\n\
		The index number is printed next to every function name so\n\
		it is easier to look up where the function in the table.\n\n\
     % time	This is the percentage of the `total' time that was spent\n\
		in this function and its children.  Note that due to\n\
		different viewpoints, functions excluded by options, etc,\n\
		these numbers will NOT add up to 100%.\n\n\
     self	This is the total amount of time spent in this function.\n\n\
     children	This is the total amount of time propagated into this\n\
		function by its children.\n\n\
     called	This is the number of times the function was called.\n\
		If the function called itself recursively, the number\n\
		only includes non-recursive calls, and is followed by\n\
		a `+' and the number of recursive calls.\n\n\
     name	The name of the current function.  The index number is\n\
		printed after it.  If the function is a member of a\n\
		cycle, the cycle number is printed between the\n\
		function's name and the index number.\n\n\n\
 For the function's parents, the fields have the following meanings:\n\n\
     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly\n\
		from the function into this parent.\n\n\
     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from\n\
		the function's children into this parent.\n\n\
     called	This is the number of times this parent called the\n\
		function `/' the total number of times the function\n\
		was called.  Recursive calls to the function are not\n\
		included in the number after the `/'.\n\n\
     name	This is the name of the parent.  The parent's index\n\
		number is printed after it.  If the parent is a\n\
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed between\n\
		the name and the index number.\n\n\
 If the parents of the function cannot be determined, the word\n\
 `<spontaneous>' is printed in the `name' field, and all the other\n\
 fields are blank.\n\n\
 For the function's children, the fields have the following meanings:\n\n\
     self	This is the amount of time that was propagated directly\n\
		from the child into the function.\n\n\
     children	This is the amount of time that was propagated from the\n\
		child's children to the function.\n\n\
     called	This is the number of times the function called\n\
		this child `/' the total number of times the child\n\
		was called.  Recursive calls by the child are not\n\
		listed in the number after the `/'.\n\n\
     name	This is the name of the child.  The child's index\n\
		number is printed after it.  If the child is a\n\
		member of a cycle, the cycle number is printed\n\
		between the name and the index number.\n\n\
 If there are any cycles (circles) in the call graph, there is an\n\
 entry for the cycle-as-a-whole.  This entry shows who called the\n\
 cycle (as parents) and the members of the cycle (as children.)\n\
 The `+' recursive calls entry shows the number of function calls that\n\
 were internal to the cycle, and the calls entry for each member shows,\n\
 for that member, how many times it was called from other members of\n\
 the cycle.\n\n";

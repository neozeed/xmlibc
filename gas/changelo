	* m68k.c Added a hack so that fsincosx fpx,fpy:fpz works.

	* messages.c New function: as_bad  This is like as_warn, except

	* atof-generic.c (atof_generic)  Ignore trailing zeroes after a decimal

	causing loss of precision.  I don't know why. . .

	* vms.c Change copyright notice.  Install changes from Kenneth Adelman
	(adelman@tgv.com) for c++?  (A dozen lines or so)

Mon Nov 13 11:48:44 EST 1989	hack@ai.mit.edu

	* version.c: Moved all comments about changes to ChangeLog (this file).
	Many anonymous entries have been attributed to Jay Fenlason (hack).

Wed Aug 2 12:55:?? 1989  Jay Fenlason (hack at apple-gunkies.ai.mit.edu)

	* sparc.c (comment_chars[]): Removed '|' because it was causing
	problems.  Probably not the best fix, since I suspect other
	assemblers (68020) may get | in .stabs also, and the 68020 needs
	the '|' comment character.

	 the check for a valid type.

	* sparc-opcode.h: Modified the entries for std "q,[1+i]", "D,[1+i]",
	and "Q,[1+i]".
